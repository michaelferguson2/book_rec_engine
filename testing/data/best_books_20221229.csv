The Lightning Thief
##Percy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or control his temper. When his mom tells him the truth about where he came from, she takes him to the one place he'll be safe—Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island). There, Percy learns that the father he never knew is actually Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon Percy finds himself caught up in a mystery that could lead to disastrous consequences. Together with his friends—a satyr and another the demigod daughter of Athena—Percy sets out on a quest to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.###
The Sea of Monsters
##After a summer spent trying to prevent a catastrophic war among the Greek gods, Percy Jackson finds his seventh-grade school year unnervingly calm. But things don't stay quiet for long. Percy soon discovers there is trouble at Camp Half-Blood: the magical borders which protect Half-Blood Hill have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and the only safe haven for demigods is on the verge of being overrun by mythological monsters. To save the camp, Percy needs the help of his best friend, Grover, who has been taken prisoner by the Cyclops Polyphemus on an island somewhere in the Sea of Monsters—the dangerous waters Greek heroes have sailed for millennia—only today, the Sea of Monsters goes by a new name: the Bermuda Triangle. Now Percy and his friends must retrieve the Golden Fleece from the Island of the Cyclops by the end of the summer or Camp Half-Blood will be destroyed. But first, Percy will learn a stunning new secret about his family—one that makes him question whether being claimed as Poseidon's son is an honor or simply a cruel joke…###
The Titan's Curse
##When Percy Jackson receives a distress call from his friend Grover, he immediately prepares for battle. He knows he'll need his powerful demigod allies, Annabeth and Thalia, at his side; his trusty bronze sword Riptide; and…a ride from his mom. The demigods race to the rescue, to find that Grover has made an important discovery: two new powerful half-bloods whose parentage is unknown. But that's not all that awaits them. The Titan lord, Kronos, has set up his most devious trap yet, and the young heroes have unwittingly fallen prey. Hilarious and action-packed, this third adventure in the series finds Percy faced with his most dangerous challenge so far: the chilling prophecy of the Titan's curse.","['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Mythology', 'Greek Mythology', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade', 'Fantasy', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Childrens']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388181482l/3165162.jpg,4.53,1032 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3165162-percy-jackson-and-the-olympians,3165162

1040,James   McBride,The Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother,"#Touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.###Who is Ruth McBride Jordan? A self-declared ""light-skinned"" woman evasive about her ethnicity, yet steadfast in her love for her twelve black children. James McBride, journalist, musician and son, explores his mother's past, as well as his own upbringing and heritage, in a poignant and powerful debut, The Color Of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother. ###The son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white, James McBride grew up in ""orchestrated chaos"" with his eleven siblings in the poor, all-black projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn. ""Mommy,"" a fiercely protective woman with ""dark eyes full of pep and fire,"" herded her brood to Manhattan's free cultural events, sent them off on buses to the best (and mainly Jewish) schools, demanded good grades and commanded respect. As a young man, McBride saw his mother as a source of embarrassment, worry, and confusion--and reached thirty before he began to discover the truth about her early life and long-buried pain. ###In The Color of Water, McBride retraces his mother's footsteps and, through her searing and spirited voice, recreates her remarkable story. The daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi, she was born Rachel Shilsky (actually Ruchel Dwara Zylska) in Poland on April 1, 1921. Fleeing pogroms, her family emigrated to America and ultimately settled in Suffolk, Virginia, a small town where anti-Semitism and racial tensions ran high. With candor and immediacy, Ruth describes her parents' loveless marriage; her fragile, handicapped mother; her cruel, sexually-abusive father; and the rest of the family and life she abandoned. ###At seventeen, after fleeing Virginia and settling in New York City, Ruth married a black minister and founded the all-black New Brown Memorial Baptist Church in her Red Hook living room. ""God is the color of water,"" Ruth McBride taught her children, firmly convinced that life's blessings and life's values transcend race. Twice widowed, and continually confronting overwhelming adversity and racism, Ruth's determination, drive and discipline saw her dozen children through college--and most through graduate school. At age 65, she herself received a degree in social work from Temple University. ###Interspersed throughout his mother's compelling narrative, McBride shares candid recollections of his own experiences as a mixed-race child of poverty, his flirtations with drugs and violence, and his eventual self-realization and professional success. The Color of Water touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.","['Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Race', 'Cultural', 'African American', 'Biography Memoir', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Academic', 'School', 'Book Club', 'Audiobook']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401311300l/29209.jpg,4.11,291 pages,(first published 1995),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29209.The_Color_of_Water,29209

1046,Norman Maclean,A River Runs Through It and Other Stories,"#Just as Norman Maclean writes at the end of ""A River Runs through It"" that he is ""haunted by waters,"" so have readers been haunted by his novella. A retired English professor who began writing fiction at the age of 70, Maclean produced what is now recognized as one of the classic American stories of the twentieth century. Originally published in 1976, A River Runs through It and Other Stories now celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary, marked by this new edition that includes a foreword by Annie Proulx.###Maclean grew up in the western Rocky Mountains in the first decades of the twentieth century. As a young man he worked many summers in logging camps and for the United States Forest Service. The two novellas and short story in this collection are based on his own experiences—the experiences of a young man who found that life was only a step from art in its structures and beauty. The beauty he found was in reality, and so he leaves a careful record of what it was like to work in the woods when it was still a world of horse and hand and foot, without power saws, ""cats,"" or four-wheel drives. Populated with drunks, loggers, card sharks, and whores, and set in the small towns and surrounding trout streams and mountains of western Montana, the stories concern themselves with the complexities of fly fishing, logging, fighting forest fires, playing cribbage, and being a husband, a son, and a father.","['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Environment', 'Nature', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Westerns', 'Audiobook']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924914l/30043.jpg,4.18,217 pages,(first published 1976),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30043.A_River_Runs_Through_It_and_Other_Stories,30043

But when she gets in the house she can't climb up on Baby Elephant's chair because it's much too big. And she can't climb on Papa Elephant's chair because it's much much too big. So she goes home. The End.###And if you don't think that's fairly stupid, you should read #""Little Red Riding Shorts""# or maybe #""The Stinky Cheese Man.""###In fact, you should definitely go read the stories now, because the rest of this description just kind of goes on and on and doesn't really say anything. I stuck it here so it would fill up the page and make it look like I really knew what I was talking about. So stop now. I mean it. Quit reading this. Open the book. If you read this last sentence, it won't tell you anything.###Signed,##Jack (Narrator)Up the HillFairy Tale Forest1992###

In their senior year, a shared research interest in adrenaline, near-death experiences, and seemingly supernatural events reveals an intriguing possibility: that under the right conditions, someone could develop extraordinary abilities.

1088,Irvine Welsh,Skagboys,"#Mark Renton has it all: he's good-looking, young, with a pretty girlfriend and a place at university. But there's no room for him in the 1980s. Thatcher's government is destroying working-class communities across Britain, and the post-war certainties of full employment, educational opportunity and a welfare state are gone. When his family starts to fracture, Mark's life swings out of control and he succumbs to the defeatism which has taken hold in Edinburgh's grimmer areas. The way out is heroin.###It's no better for his friends. Spud Murphy is paid off from his job, Tommy Lawrence feels himself being sucked into a life of petty crime and violence - the worlds of the thieving Matty Connell and psychotic Franco Begbie. Only Sick Boy, the supreme manipulator of the opposite sex, seems to ride the current, scamming and hustling his way through it all.###Skagboys #charts their journey from likely lads to young men addicted to the heroin which has flooded their disintegrating community. This is the 1980s: a time of drugs, poverty, AIDS, violence, political strife and hatred - but a lot of laughs, and maybe just a little love; a decade which changed Britain for ever. The prequel to the world-renowned #Trainspotting#, this is an exhilarating and moving book, full of the scabrous humour, salty vernacular and appalling behaviour that has made Irvine Welsh a household name.","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Cultural', 'Scotland', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Dark', 'Novels', 'Drama', 'Adult']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333576361l/12926063.jpg,4.02,548 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12926063-skagboys,12926063

1101,Ray Bradbury,The Illustrated Man,"#That #The Illustrated Man# has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first was #Dark Carnival#, later reworked into #The October Country#), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as ""The Veldt,"" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or ""Kaleidoscope,"" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or ""Zero Hour,"" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. #--Stanley Wiater###Contents:###· Prologue: The Illustrated Man · ss * ##· The Veldt [“The World the Children Made”] · ss The Saturday Evening Post Sep 23 ’50 ##· Kaleidoscope · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Oct ’49 ##· The Other Foot · ss New Story Magazine Mar ’51 ##· The Highway [as by Leonard Spalding] · ss Copy Spr ’50 ##· The Man · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Feb ’49 ##· The Long Rain [“Death-by-Rain”] · ss Planet Stories Sum ’50 ##· The Rocket Man · ss Maclean’s Mar 1 ’51 ##· The Fire Balloons [“‘In This Sign...’”] · ss Imagination Apr ’51 ##· The Last Night of the World · ss Esquire Feb ’51 ##· The Exiles [“The Mad Wizards of Mars”] · ss Maclean’s Sep 15 ’49; F&SF Win ’50 ##· No Particular Night or Morning · ss * ##· The Fox and the Forest [“To the Future”] · ss Colliers May 13 ’50 ##· The Visitor · ss Startling Stories Nov ’48 ##· The Concrete Mixer · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Apr ’49 ##· Marionettes, Inc.

He soon meets Josella, another lucky person who has retained her sight, and together they leave the city, aware that the safe, familiar world they knew a mere twenty-four hours before is gone forever.###But to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, one must survive the Triffids, strange plants that years before began appearing all over the world. The Triffids can grow to over seven feet tall, pull their roots from the ground to walk, and kill a man with one quick lash of their poisonous stingers. With society in shambles, they are now poised to prey on humankind.

But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate. ###Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone. ###During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love. ###In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.","['Romance', 'Fiction', 'Womens Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Romance', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Drama', 'Love', 'Romance', 'Love Story']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385055753l/3462.jpg,4.12,352 pages,(first published 2000),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3462.The_Rescue,3462

And in the doing, it will take her to the edge of despair... and beyond.

Images from that war -- and the protests against it -- had flooded America's living rooms for a decade. Hearts in Atlantis, King's newest fiction, is composed of five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War. ###In Part One, ""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood. He also discovers that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror. ###In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast. ###In ""Blind Willie"" and ""Why We're in Vietnam,"" two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow -- and as haunted -- as their own lives. ###And in ""Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,"" this remarkable book's denouement, Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, the hope of redemption, and his heart's desire may await him. ###Full of danger, full of suspense, most of all full of heart, Stephen King's new book will take some readers to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.","['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Short Stories', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Fantasy', 'Supernatural', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'War']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374048926l/11602.jpg,3.84,640 pages,(first published September 14th 1999),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11602.Hearts_in_Atlantis,11602

Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales, a literary genre he so mastered that he himself has become as mythical as the tales he wrote. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories - called eventyrs, or ""fantastic tales"" - express themes that transcend age and nationality.###During his lifetime he was acclaimed for having delighted children worldwide and was feted by royalty. Andersen's fairy tales, which have been translated into more than 125 languages, have become culturally embedded in the West's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature listeners/readers as well. They have inspired motion pictures, plays, ballets, and animated films.","['Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Fantasy', 'Fairy Tales', 'Short Stories', 'Literature', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Folklore', 'Young Adult']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385233181l/46306.jpg,4.29,803 pages,(first published December 1872),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46306.The_Complete_Fairy_Tales,46306

1178,Paul Kalanithi,When Breath Becomes Air,"#For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question 'What makes a life worth living?'###At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. #When Breath Becomes Air# chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed,"" as he wrote, ""by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. ###What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. ###Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,"" he wrote. ""Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'"" #When Breath Becomes Air# is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.","['Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Health', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Philosophy', 'Science']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492677644l/25899336.jpg,4.39,208 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air,25899336

1183,Fernando Pessoa,The Book of Disquiet: The Complete Edition,"#Această carte aproape mitică, probabil opera cea mai seducătoare a lui Fernando Pessoa, e un monolog de o tristețe indicibilă, care surprinde cu o minuție halucinantă interiorul cu mii de fațete al unuia dintre numeroși săi heteronimi, Bernardo Soares.###„Cine este Fernando Pessoa?"" se întreba Octavio Paz, adeverind încă o dată că opera unuia dintre cei mai importanţi, prolifici şi proteiformi autori ai secolului XX, „investigatorul solemn al lucrurilor futile"", declină personalităţile virtuale coexistând în sine şi revelate graţie scriiturii ce atribuie fiecăreia o realitate fictivă. Scrisă între 1913 şi 1935 sub formă de panseuri, maxime, aforisme, Cartea neliniştirii, pseudojurnalul pessoan, este o cronică a deziluziei şi a deriziunii izvorâte din convingerea că viaţa e lipsită de noimă, iar arta nu-i conferă nici un sens. Ferit de privirile contemporanilor, cultivându-şi sistematic forţa imaginaţiei, Pessoa îşi construieşte un dublu - Bernando Soares - pe care-l aşază într-un univers personal ireal şi cu toate astea mai adevărat, pentru el, decât lumea reală. Soares, un umil funcţionar în costume cenuşii, alege să-şi petreacă viaţa într-o izolare aproape monahală, mai degrabă visând-o decât trăind-o, privind-o fără pretenţia de a o descifra şi proiectând asupra ei propriile emoţii pe care le încearcă închis între pereţii camerei unde îşi aşterne pe hârtie disperarea. Soares scrie cu luciditate, îndârjire şi furie, împingând introspecţia până la limita incomunicabilului. Dar dincolo de zidurile care-l împrejmuiesc se zăreşte urbea. Peisajul citadin este atât de prezent în toată cartea, încât fragmentele de însemnări încheagă un roman al oraşului cu care, de fapt, Pessoa are o legătură profundă, în genul aceleia pe care Baudelaire o are cu Parisul, Joyce, cu Dublinul şi Kafka, cu Praga. Şi poate tocmai aceste privelişti din fascinanta Lisabonă, cu străduţele ei întortocheate pulsând de viaţă, poartă cu ele speranţa unei posibile evadări.","['Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Literature', 'Cultural', 'Portugal', 'European Literature', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Unfinished']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1591219012l/40881621._SX318_.jpg,4.42,433 pages,(first published 1961),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40881621-the-book-of-disquiet,40881621

Maternal instinct knows no boundaries, including the nano-neural-net intravenously installed in Dannia Weston's mind to repress her identity, allowing her to perform a mission 300 years before her time. Transported to the year 1954, Dannia becomes a woman with a mid-twentieth century persona, college educated with an aptitude for mechanical invention. Due to her work during the war, she is employed by the U.S. government on a secret project. But what no one knows-including Dannia or those who sent her back to tinker with the mechanical past to reduce future pollution-is what might happen should she become emotionally involved in 1954. The 2254 science team programmed the nano-net to prevent the possibility of pregnancy, but each person reacts to strong emotional stimuli differently, and using birth control not available in 1954 is out of the question. When Dannia falls in love with Peter Hersh and becomes pregnant, her hormones erode a small section of the nano-chained network that stabilizes her new identity, triggering a mild memory rebirth...and threatening her mission and the fate of the world.","['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Young Adult', 'Space', 'Science Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Space', 'Space Opera', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Adventure']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1444879956l/27111181.jpg,4.34,284 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27111181-paradox-effect,27111181

Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life—having nothing but his own wits to help him along. ###Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village's wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man's (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram's new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of Murder Weekly (""Love -- Rape -- Revenge!""), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive. ###Balram's eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn't create virtue, and money doesn't solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations. ###The White Tiger recalls The Death of Vishnu and Bangkok 8 in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own.

It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. ###In #Quiet, #Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions.

1280,Arthur Koestler,Darkness at Noon,"#Darkness at Noon (from the German: Sonnenfinsternis) is a novel by the Hungarian-born British novelist Arthur Koestler, first published in 1940. His best-known work tells the tale of Rubashov, a Bolshevik 1917 revolutionary who is cast out, imprisoned and tried for treason by the Soviet government he'd helped create.###Darkness at Noon stands as an unequaled fictional portrayal of the nightmare politics of our time. Its hero is an aging revolutionary, imprisoned and psychologically tortured by the Party to which he has dedicated his life. As the pressure to confess preposterous crimes increases, he relives a career that embodies the terrible ironies and human betrayals of a totalitarian movement masking itself as an instrument of deliverance. Almost unbearably vivid in its depiction of one man's solitary agony, it asks questions about ends and means that have relevance not only for the past but for the perilous present. It is —- as the Times Literary Supplement has declared —- ""A remarkable book, a grimly fascinating interpretation of the logic of the Russian Revolution, indeed of all revolutionary dictatorships, and at the same time a tense and subtly intellectualized drama.""","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Politics', 'Literature', 'Cultural', 'Russia', 'Novels', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Philosophy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1290053535l/30672.jpg,4.10,216 pages,(first published 1940),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30672.Darkness_at_Noon,30672

Her musings on sadistic nuns, domestic violence, emerging sexuality, and God the Father’s romantic life will delight readers. ###Bridget creates glorious supernatural worlds—with exorcisms, bird relics, Virgin Martyrs, time travel, Biblical plagues, even the ‘holy’ in holy water—to cope with a family where leather handbags and even garlic can cause explosions. ###An avid Bible reader who innocently believes everything the nuns tell her, Bridget’s saints, martyrs, and boney Christs become alive and audible within her. While the nuns chide her sinful ‘mathematical pride’ and slow eating habits, God answers her prayers instantly by day, but the devil visits nightly in the dark. Scenes run the gamut from laugh-out-loud Catholic brainwashing of children, to heart-wrenching abuse, to riveting teenage excursions toward sex. ###Young Bridget tries to make sense of a world of raging men and domestically subjugated women and carve a future for herself, wrestling with how God and men treat women. Her Italian female relatives—glamorous Santa Anna, black-and-blue Aunt Maria, sophisticated Eleanor with a New York ‘Fellini pageboy’—offer sensual alternatives to the repression of her immediate family. She prays fervently that “despite God’s bizarre treatment of married women... some [girls] might still discover ways to have a great time without being a nun.” ###Dodging Satan is the flip-side of l'Histoire d'une Âme by Saint Thérèse of Lisieux authored by a twentieth century American girl chomping on a blue-gum cigar while she talks to a confidant about God and sex.","['Drama', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Fiction']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1448816156l/28009303._SY475_.jpg,4.29,191 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28009303-dodging-satan,28009303

1289,Jonathan Franzen,Freedom,"#Patty and Walter Berglund were the new pioneers of old St. Paul—the gentrifiers, the hands-on parents, the avant-garde of the Whole Foods generation. Patty was the ideal sort of neighbor, who could tell you where to recycle your batteries and how to get the local cops to actually do their job. She was an enviably perfect mother and the wife of Walter's dreams. Together with Walter—environmental lawyer, commuter cyclist, total family man—she was doing her small part to build a better world.###But now, in the new millennium, the Berglunds have become a mystery. Why has their teenage son moved in with the aggressively Republican family next door? Why has Walter taken a job working with Big Coal? What exactly is Richard Katz—outré rocker and Walter's college best friend and rival—still doing in the picture? Most of all, what has happened to Patty? Why has the bright star of Barrier Street become ""a very different kind of neighbor,"" an implacable Fury coming unhinged before the street's attentive eyes?###In his first novel since #The Corrections#, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Freedom's characters as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.##(jacket)","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Literature', 'American', 'Adult Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Family', 'The United States Of America']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316729686l/7905092.jpg,3.77,562 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7905092-freedom,7905092

1310,William Shakespeare,As You Like It,"#Readers and audiences have long greeted #As You Like It with delight.# Its characters are brilliant conversationalists, including the princesses Rosalind and Celia and their Fool, Touchstone. Soon after Rosalind and Orlando meet and fall in love, the princesses and Touchstone go into exile in the Forest of Arden, where they find new conversational partners. Duke Frederick, younger brother to Duke Senior, has overthrown his brother and forced him to live homeless in the forest with his courtiers, including the cynical Jaques. Orlando, whose older brother Oliver plotted his death, has fled there, too.###Recent scholars have also grounded the play in the issues of its time. These include primogeniture, passing property from a father to his oldest son. As You Like It depicts intense conflict between brothers, exposing the human suffering that primogeniture entails. Another perspective concerns cross-dressing. Most of Orlando’s courtship of Rosalind takes place while Rosalind is disguised as a man, “Ganymede.” At her urging, Orlando pretends that Ganymede is his beloved Rosalind. But as the epilogue reveals, the sixteenth-century actor playing Rosalind was male, following the practice of the time. In other words, a boy played a girl playing a boy pretending to be a girl.","['Classics', 'Plays', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'Plays', 'Theatre', 'Romance', 'Literature', 'Academic', 'School', 'Poetry', 'Humor', 'Comedy']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1561383241l/42607._SY475_.jpg,3.82,263 pages,(first published 1599),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42607.As_You_Like_It,42607

Following the prides and passions of a group of Jews, Romans and Barbarians living at the time of the siege, the narrative is centered on an ill-fated romance between a steadfast slave girl, Hadassah, and Marcus, the brother of her owner and a handsome aristocrat. After surviving the massacre of her family and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, Hadassah is captured and sold to a well-to-do merchant’s family. Brought to Rome, she is pressed into service as a personal slave to hedonistic Julia Valerian. Hadassah struggles to walk in the footsteps of Jesus and to treat her masters in a manner in keeping with His teachings, but she is forced to keep her religious identity a secret in order to survive. Confused and alone, she has only her faith to cling to as she tries to subtly bring God into the lives of her captors. Reckless, impulsive, and villainous, Julia tries to undermine Hadassah at every turn. But Julia’s brother, Marcus, is a different sort altogether. Is it possible for a love between Hadassah and Marcus to flourish considering not only their differing stations in life, but also the gap between Hadassah’s unrelenting faith and Marcus’ lack of belief in anything? Simultaneously, Atretes, a captured soldier from Germania, is forced to become a gladiator. This is the time of Rome’s decline and the decadence of a civilization on the verge of self-destruction serves as a powerful backdrop to the Barbarian’s struggle for survival in the arena.","['Christian Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Christian', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Historical Romance', 'Romance', 'Christian Romance', 'Religion', 'Adult']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459567327l/95617.jpg,4.56,520 pages,(first published March 1993),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95617.A_Voice_in_the_Wind,95617

And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longed-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage, and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'The United States Of America', 'American', 'Americana', 'Contemporary']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1504801263l/11650._SY475_.jpg,3.94,432 pages,(first published May 12th 1997),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11650.American_Pastoral,11650
1377,Deborah Leblanc,Toe to Toe,"#Welcome to Clay Point, Louisiana, home to not-so-average Joes, and Nonie Broussard, a feisty Cajun and trouble magnet. After losing her job when the Garmin factory shuts down, Nonie is left with major money issues—as in, she has none. Desperate, she has to turn to the one place she’s avoided working since dropping out of college--her family’s funeral home.##It wasn’t that Nonie feared the dead. In fact the opposite was true. She sees them—literally, and had been seeing the dead ever since she can remember. She tried telling her parents about it when she was a child, but they’d vehemently dismissed it to imaginary friends, so she’d stopped talking about it. There were only two people who actually knew Nonie’s secret and knew she was the real deal. One was Buggy Mouton, her best friend since kindergarten, and the other was Guy Skinard, whom Nonie considered her one true love since the day she’d laid eyes on him in high school. Buggy now worked at MeeMaw’s Café off of Main in Clay Point, and Guy, as usual, remained ever at her side—the only difference being he’d died in a freak boating accident nine years ago. Still the prankster even in death, Guy loved causing chaos, especially with men Nonie occasionally dated. She could only imagine what mayhem he might stir up while mirroring her at the funeral home and mingling with the newly departed.##Only hours into the first day of her new job, pandemonium engulfs the funeral home, and much to Nonie’s surprise, it has nothing to do with Guy. It’s brought on by the family they’re serving. Seventy-two–year-old Dover Fontenot, the Major of Clay Point, dies in a car accident after indulging in a little extra-curricular activity—only the activity wasn’t with his wife , Hazel. And when Dover’s mistress, Anna Mae Turner, shows up at the funeral home for the visitation hell’s gates rip open and Broussard’s Funeral Home suddenly turns into a geriatric war zone.##Amidst the flying hairpieces, canes and curses, Nonie’s best friend, Buggy, decides to drop by the funeral home with news she can’t wait to share. A cable network in New Orleans wants to put together a paranormal investigation team and have them check out purported haunted locations in Louisiana. For every location with solid filming potential, each member of the team gets a five hundred dollar pay check. And Buggy knows without question that if anyone can sniff out the ‘restless’ dead, it’s Nonie.##Knowing nothing about paranormal investigation, but lured by the sound of the adventure and the dollar signs circling through her head, Nonie agrees to become part of the Boo Krewe, the name Buggy has formally given the makeshift team.##The lure of money may be one thing, but what Nonie doesn’t realize is that occasionally the dead, so excited that someone can actually see and hear them, decide to follow her home, into her bed—the bathroom—the shower. And adding to this new-found frustration, Nonie barely finishes her first investigation when she gets a visit from Anna Mae Turner—the mayor’s former mistress—now dead, as well, and harassingly insistent that Nonie bring her killer to light.##Nonie quickly learns that the ‘gift’ she’s carried since birth is really a giant wart on the butt of life—and no amount of Compound W is going to make it go away!","['Fiction', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Epic', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Mystery', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440442093l/26157586.jpg,4.22,304 pages,(first published November 17th 2015),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26157586-toe-to-toe,26157586

1384,Omar Farhad,Honor and Polygamy,"#Heartbreaking and timely novel by Afghan-American author follows one man's journey from New York to the clutches of the Taliban and into an unintentional polygamist union. ""He is picking up the same bags with the same clothes Lisa packed and folded a year ago. He wishes he were like his clothes, untouched by external forces."" Family man Nick Blake is living in New York City and working for the United Nations. Born and raised in the United States with broad knowledge of the Afghan culture, he is living the All-American life with his wife, Lisa, and their children. His life is turned upside down when, while on a diplomatic mission to Afghanistan, Nick is kidnapped and finds himself in the clutches of the Taliban. Omar Farhad's debut novel Honor and Polygamy follows Nick throughout his eighteen months in Afghanistan and the devastating and unexpected turns his life takes, as he learns the true meanings of home, history and culture. After being held captive for several months, Nick is forced to marry the sixteen-year-old Shaista. Although he cannot forget his beloved wife and children back home, he finds himself falling in love with his second wife and, overwhelmed with guilt, is torn between his old life and his new one. Honor and Polygamy is far from simply a captivating fiction story, but is also a brilliant commentary on the United States' situation with Afghanistan. Farhad expresses his views on both the political and the cultural sides of Afghanistan. Politically, he is predicting how he feels the war will ultimately end, while culturally, he shows readers not familiar with Afghanistan that the 35-year-old war has created a population, which is uneducated, disloyal, and without identity. The United States and many other nations have continuously disrupted Afghanistan with no clear political objectives, and, in his novel, Farhad explores the consequences of these actions. The story of Nick Blake represents the reality of the Afghan culture and the results and disappointments of the political realities in Afghanistan, and shows readers just how unaware we all are of other cultures. Written by an author who has lived both the American and Afghan ways of life, Honor and Polygamy is a harrowing, haunting and deeply moving tale for our times.","['Fiction', 'Politics', 'Polyamory', 'Polygamy', 'Contemporary']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400872547l/22242097.jpg,4.24,132 pages,(first published May 2014),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22242097-honor-and-polygamy,22242097

1387,Nelson Mandela,Long Walk to Freedom,"#Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. ###Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa's anti-apartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality. ###The foster son of a Thembu chief, Mandela was raised in the traditional, tribal culture of his ancestors, but at an early age learned the modern, inescapable reality of what came to be called apartheid, one of the most powerful and effective systems of oppression ever conceived. In classically elegant and engrossing prose, he tells of his early years as an impoverished student and law clerk in a Jewish firm in Johannesburg, of his slow political awakening, and of his pivotal role in the rebirth of a stagnant ANC and the formation of its Youth League in the 1950s. ###He describes the struggle to reconcile his political activity with his devotion to his family, the anguished breakup of his first marriage, and the painful separations from his children. He brings vividly to life the escalating political warfare in the fifties between the ANC and the government, culminating in his dramatic escapades as an underground leader and the notorious Rivonia Trial of 1964, at which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Herecounts the surprisingly eventful twenty-seven years in prison and the complex, delicate negotiations that led both to his freedom and to the beginning of the end of apartheid. Finally he provides the ultimate inside account.","['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Cultural', 'Africa', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Politics', 'Southern Africa', 'South Africa', 'Biography Memoir', 'Race']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327997342l/318431.jpg,4.33,656 pages,(first published 1994),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/318431.Long_Walk_to_Freedom,318431

Несмотря на порою шокирующий натурализм, его тексты полны лиричности, даже своеобразной сентиментальности.##Роман ""Женщины"" написан им на волне популярности и содержит массу фирменных ""фишек"" Буковски: самоиронию, обилие сексуальных сцен, энергию сюжета. Герою книги 50 лет, его зовут Генри Чинаски, и он является неизменным альтер-эго автора. Роман представляет собой череду более чем откровенных сексуальных сцен, которые объединены главным - бесконечной любовью героя к своим женщинам, любованием ими и грубовато-искренним восхищением.##Бунтарь и романтик, не желающий вписываться ни в какие рамки, презирающий какие бы то ни было правила, - такой образ возникает у каждого, кто читает книги Чарльза Буковски.##Те, кто услышит в его нарочито брутальной прозе и поэзии музыку, разглядит за маской циника и сквернослова поэзию, полюбят его навсегда.##Буковски же, кажется, было все равно, будет ли он услышан. Он шел своим путем, презирая рафинированных людей и рафинированное, выхолощенное искусство.###""Пока мужчины смотрят футбол, или пьют пиво, или шастают по кегельбанам, они, женщины эти, думают о нас, сосредотачиваются, изучают, решают - принять нас, выкинуть, обменять, убить или просто бросить"".","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Poetry', 'Literature', 'American', 'Contemporary', 'Humor', 'The United States Of America', 'Literature', '20th Century']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1325028693l/38500.jpg,3.83,291 pages,(first published 1978),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38500.Women,38500
1396,David James Duncan,The Brothers K,"#Duncan took almost 10 years to follow up the publication of his much-praised first novel, #The River Why#, but this massive second effort is well worth the wait. It is a stunning work: a complex tapestry of family tensions, baseball, politics and religion, by turns hilariously funny and agonizingly sad. Highly inventive formally, the novel is mainly narrated by Kincaid Chance, the youngest son in a family of four boys and identical twin girls, the children of Hugh Chance, a discouraged minor-league ballplayer whose once-promising career was curtained by an industrial accident, and his wife Laura, an increasingly fanatical Seventh-Day Adventist. The plot traces the working-out of the family's fate from the beginning of the Eisenhower years through the traumas of Vietnam.","['Fiction', 'Sports', 'Baseball', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Sports', 'Sports', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Family', 'Literature', 'Classics', 'Religion']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403176622l/19534.jpg,4.38,645 pages,(first published January 1st 1992),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19534.The_Brothers_K,19534

1400,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,Half of a Yellow Sun,"#A masterly, haunting new novel from a writer heralded by The Washington Post Book World as “the 21st-century daughter of Chinua Achebe,” Half of a Yellow Sun re-creates a seminal moment in modern African history: Biafra’s impassioned struggle to establish an independent republic in Nigeria in the 1960s, and the chilling violence that followed. ###With astonishing empathy and the effortless grace of a natural storyteller, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie weaves together the lives of three characters swept up in the turbulence of the decade. Thirteen-year-old Ugwu is employed as a houseboy for a university professor full of revolutionary zeal. Olanna is the professor’s beautiful mistress, who has abandoned her life of privilege in Lagos for a dusty university town and the charisma of her new lover. And Richard is a shy young Englishman in thrall to Olanna’s twin sister, an enigmatic figure who refuses to belong to anyone. As Nigerian troops advance and the three must run for their lives, their ideals are severely tested, as are their loyalties to one another. ###Epic, ambitious, and triumphantly realized, Half of a Yellow Sun is a remarkable novel about moral responsibility, about the end of colonialism, about ethnic allegiances, about class and race—and the ways in which love can complicate them all. Adichie brilliantly evokes the promise and the devastating disappointments that marked this time and place, bringing us one of the most powerful, dramatic, and intensely emotional pictures of modern Africa that we have ever had.","['Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Cultural', 'Africa', 'Western Africa', 'Nigeria', 'War', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'African Literature', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327934717l/18749.jpg,4.33,433 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18749.Half_of_a_Yellow_Sun,18749

Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.###Casting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.","['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Skepticism', 'Religion', 'Atheism', 'Science', 'Popular Science', 'Psychology', 'Science', 'Physics']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553691804l/17349._SX318_.jpg,4.28,459 pages,(first published February 1st 1996),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World,17349

And behind every move is their heir, Roma Montagov, Juliette’s first love…and first betrayal.###But when gangsters on both sides show signs of instability culminating in clawing their own throats out, the people start to whisper.

The Germanic tribes would associate for their common good, often meeting and forming up for offensive or defensive war, but they were always separate and very independent.

In due course, this resulted in even the members of his own family taking up arms against him in order to make sure that the tribes of Germania remained independent and free. Such was the concern of the ancient Germanic tribesmen that this might not be the case, that Armin was murdered by the members of his own family.","['Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'New Adult', 'Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Romance', 'Love Story', 'Romance']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499685145l/35642518._SY475_.jpg,4.29,325 pages,(first published August 31st 2015),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35642518-for-the-love-of-armin,35642518

Then, to her amazement, the “coolest girl in the world” moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer’s end they’ve become #TullyandKate.# Inseparable.###So begins Kristin Hannah’s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, #Firefly Lane# is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.###From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. ###Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn’t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she’ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she’ll envy her famous best friend. . . .###For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they’ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.###Firefly Lane# is for anyone who ever drank Boone’s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac.

Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.","['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Science', 'Technology', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511288482l/11084145._SY475_.jpg,4.16,630 pages,(first published October 1st 2011),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs,11084145

Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style. But because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition indeed. The ruling elite therefore mustn’t know the full scope or nature of the project, and panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears. The only clue to the mystery–or crime? –lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves.

1514,Ocean Vuong,On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous,"#On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous# is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, #On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous# is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.###With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.","['Fiction', 'Poetry', 'LGBT', 'Contemporary', 'LGBT', 'Queer', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1615580168l/41880609._SY475_.jpg,4.05,246 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41880609-on-earth-we-re-briefly-gorgeous,41880609

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.###Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking.

1531,Biao  Wang,Journey to the West: A Long March from Eastern Dream to Western Reality,"#Biao Wang's memoir 'JOURNEY TO THE WEST' is a fascinating account of the passage of a poor boy from a small, impoverished rural Chinese village to a brilliant, international commercial career and will read as a truly inspiring example of what can be achieved from the least promising background through determination and imagination. ###A potted history of modern China leads seamlessly into the story of a young man who, with a combination of remarkable foresight, dedication and courage, has built several successful businesses and established himself at a remarkably young age as a leader in international commercial co-operation. ## ##Here is somebody who has grasped life eagerly, and what his buoyant tale demonstrates is the importance of seeing opportunity and unhesitatingly pursuing it; the story bursts with energy and practical wisdom without any sense of self-importance, whilst taking us stage by stage through Biao's interesting life. From his relatively carefree, if impoverished, childhood in a small village, he takes us, unhurriedly through his education and early struggles, to his great leap forward when he bravely sets out for the unknown world of England, determined to immerse himself in its culture rather than retreating into the comfortable familiarity of his compatriots, seizing opportunities as they arise, always aware of his place in the wider scheme of things. ###The narrative offers an intriguing picture of life in contemporary China, and on the way explains much about the Chinese character and attitudes. His insights into what makes for success are almost incidental as we follow his journey from grinding poverty to commercial achievement. Those from similar backgrounds in any part of the world can take courage from this eloquent account of the power of determination; readers anywhere can share in his infectious enthusiasm for life and all the opportunities it offers. ###“JOURNEY TO THE WEST” is also a timely reminder, at a time when the emerging power of China is seen as a threat to the West, that we are all one species, with the same needs and desires, as through his storytelling Biao Wang gives China and the Chinese a human face. ## ##“JOURNEY TO THE WEST” is a cultural bridge as well as a thoroughly enjoyable and absorbing read. ###As Biao Wang most eloquently says “having travelled the world and witnessed many inequalities and the problems such different starting blocks can bring, if I’ve learned anything, it is that success is always possible, whatever your situation and however your life begins.” ## ##So, fasten your seat belts and take note as you travel from one extraordinary chapter to another – it should be an inspiration to us all.","['Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Cultural', 'China', 'History']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1608804980l/56397497._SY475_.jpg,4.30,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56397497-journey-to-the-west,56397497

That was the whole reason she was sent to Hex Hall, a reform school for delinquent Prodigium (a.k.a. witches, shape-shifters, and faeries). But then she discovered the family secret, and the fact that her hot crush, Archer Cross, is an agent for The Eye, a group bent on wiping Prodigium off the face of the earth.###Turns out, Sophie's a demon, one of only two in the world-the other being her father. What's worse, she has powers that threaten the lives of everyone she loves. Which is precisely why Sophie decides she must go to London for the Removal, a dangerous procedure that will either destroy her powers for good-or kill her. ###But once Sophie arrives, she makes a shocking discovery. Her new housemates? They're demons too. Meaning, someone is raising demons in secret, with creepy plans to use their powers, and probably not for good. Meanwhile, The Eye is set on hunting Sophie down, and they're using Archer to do it. But it's not like she has feelings for him anymore.

Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison.

1567,Irène Némirovsky,Suite Française,"#The first two stories of a masterwork once thought lost, written by a pre-WWII bestselling author who was deported to Auschwitz and died before her work could be completed.###By the early l940s, when Ukrainian-born Irène Némirovsky began working on what would become Suite Française—the first two parts of a planned five-part novel—she was already a highly successful writer living in Paris. But she was also a Jew, and in 1942 she was arrested and deported to Auschwitz: a month later she was dead at the age of thirty-nine. Two years earlier, living in a small village in central France—where she, her husband, and their two small daughters had fled in a vain attempt to elude the Nazis—she'd begun her novel, a luminous portrayal of a human drama in which she herself would become a victim. When she was arrested, she had completed two parts of the epic, the handwritten manuscripts of which were hidden in a suitcase that her daughters would take with them into hiding and eventually into freedom. Sixty-four years later, at long last, we can read Némirovsky's literary masterpiece ###The first part, ""A Storm in June,"" opens in the chaos of the massive 1940 exodus from Paris on the eve of the Nazi invasion during which several families and individuals are thrown together under circumstances beyond their control. They share nothing but the harsh demands of survival—some trying to maintain lives of privilege, others struggling simply to preserve their lives—but soon, all together, they will be forced to face the awful exigencies of physical and emotional displacement, and the annihilation of the world they know. In the second part, ""Dolce,"" we enter the increasingly complex life of a German-occupied provincial village. Coexisting uneasily with the soldiers billeted among them, the villagers—from aristocrats to shopkeepers to peasants—cope as best they can. Some choose resistance, others collaboration, and as their community is transformed by these acts, the lives of these these men and women reveal nothing less than the very essence of humanity.###Suite Française is a singularly piercing evocation—at once subtle and severe, deeply compassionate, and fiercely ironic—of life and death in occupied France, and a brilliant, profoundly moving work of art.","['Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Cultural', 'France', 'War', 'World War II', 'War', 'Historical', 'Classics', 'World War II', 'Holocaust', 'Book Club', 'Novels']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557142046l/43944._SY475_.jpg,3.84,431 pages,(first published September 2004),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43944.Suite_Fran_aise,43944

When he loses yet another job, he makes an impulsive decision: he will move his family north, to Alaska, where they will live off the grid in America’s last true frontier.###Thirteen-year-old Leni, a girl coming of age in a tumultuous time, caught in the riptide of her parents’ passionate, stormy relationship, dares to hope that a new land will lead to a better future for her family. She is desperate for a place to belong. Her mother, Cora, will do anything and go anywhere for the man she loves, even if it means following him into the unknown.###At first, Alaska seems to be the answer to their prayers. In a wild, remote corner of the state, they find a fiercely independent community of strong men and even stronger women. The long, sunlit days and the generosity of the locals make up for the Allbrights’ lack of preparation and dwindling resources.###But as winter approaches and darkness descends on Alaska, Ernt’s fragile mental state deteriorates and the family begins to fracture. Soon the perils outside pale in comparison to threats from within. In their small cabin, covered in snow, blanketed in eighteen hours of night, Leni and her mother learn the terrible truth: they are on their own. In the wild, there is no one to save them but themselves.###In this unforgettable portrait of human frailty and resilience, Kristin Hannah reveals the indomitable character of the modern American pioneer and the spirit of a vanishing Alaska―a place of incomparable beauty and danger.

The work of English clergyman, educator and Shakespearean scholar Edwin A. Abbott (1838-1926), it describes the journeys of A. Square #[sic – ed.]#, a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women-thin, straight lines-are the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status.##Through strange occurrences that bring him into contact with a host of geometric forms, Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions), Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions—a revolutionary idea for which he is returned to his two-dimensional world. Charmingly illustrated by the author, Flatland is not only fascinating reading, it is still a first-rate fictional introduction to the concept of the multiple dimensions of space.

Stalin’s Five Year Plan brings genocide to Ukraine – millions of people starve to death. To free themselves from the daily terrors of Soviet rule, Stefan and his friends fight imaginary battles in nearby woods to defend their land. The games they play are their only escape. ###‘Sliding on the Snow Stone’ is the true story of Stefan's extraordinary journey across a landscape of hunger, fear and devastating loss. With Europe on the brink of World War Two, Stefan and his family pray they'll survive in their uncertain world. They long to be free.## ##(In 1932-33, as part of their drive towards industrialisation, the Soviet Union demanded impossibly high requisitions of grain from rural areas in Ukraine. In a deliberate act of genocide, Ukrainian smallholdings were stripped of food, and the population began to perish, with some estimates as high as 10 million deaths, from starvation. In Ukraine, this atrocity became known as the Holodomor (death by hunger). The following years saw Soviet purges and terrors resulting in the elimination of academics and intellectuals, or of anyone who spoke out against Soviet rule. When World War Two arrived on Ukraine’s doorstep, many people viewed the Nazis as liberators – a view that was quickly proved wrong. ‘Sliding on the Snow Stone’ is Stefan’s personal account of a historical period drenched in the blood of a nation, and of his yearning for freedom).","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Cultural', 'Ukraine', 'War', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'War', 'World War II', 'Historical', 'Cultural', 'Russia']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327983970l/12853168.jpg,3.68,238 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12853168-sliding-on-the-snow-stone,12853168

1580,Colum McCann,Let the Great World Spin,"#In the dawning light of a late-summer morning, the people of lower Manhattan stand hushed, staring up in disbelief at the Twin Towers. It is August 1974, and a mysterious tightrope walker is running, dancing, leaping between the towers, suspended a quarter mile above the ground. In the streets below, a slew of ordinary lives become extraordinary in bestselling novelist Colum McCann’s stunningly intricate portrait of a city and its people.##Let the Great World Spin# is the critically acclaimed author’s most ambitious novel yet: a dazzlingly rich vision of the pain, loveliness, mystery, and promise of New York City in the 1970s.###Corrigan, a radical young Irish monk, struggles with his own demons as he lives among the prostitutes in the middle of the burning Bronx. A group of mothers gather in a Park Avenue apartment to mourn their sons who died in Vietnam, only to discover just how much divides them even in grief. A young artist finds herself at the scene of a hit-and-run that sends her own life careening sideways. Tillie, a thirty-eight-year-old grandmother, turns tricks alongside her teenage daughter, determined not only to take care of her family but to prove her own worth.###Elegantly weaving together these and other seemingly disparate lives, McCann’s powerful allegory comes alive in the unforgettable voices of the city’s people, unexpectedly drawn together by hope, beauty, and the “artistic crime of the century.” A sweeping and radical social novel, #Let the Great World Spin# captures the spirit of America in a time of transition, extraordinary promise, and, in hindsight, heartbreaking innocence. Hailed as a “fiercely original talent” (San Francisco Chronicle), award-winning novelist McCann has delivered a triumphantly American masterpiece that awakens in us a sense of what the novel can achieve, confront, and even heal.","['Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'New York', 'Book Club', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Adult Fiction']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474988022l/5941033.jpg,3.94,351 pages,(first published June 16th 2009),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin,5941033

1590,Tom Wolfe,The Right Stuff,"#Tom Wolfe began #The Right Stuff# at a time when it was unfashionable to contemplate American heroism. Nixon had left the White House in disgrace, the nation was reeling from the catastrophe of Vietnam, and in 1979--the year the book appeared--Americans were being held hostage by Iranian militants. Yet it was exactly the anachronistic courage of his subjects that captivated Wolfe. In his foreword, he notes that as late as 1970, almost one in four career Navy pilots died in accidents. ""#The Right Stuff#,"" he explains, ""became a story of why men were willing--willing?--delighted!--to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero."" # Wolfe's roots in New Journalism were intertwined with the nonfiction novel that Truman Capote had pioneered with In Cold Blood. As Capote did, Wolfe tells his story from a limited omniscient perspective, dropping into the lives of his ""characters"" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program. After an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier. Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines, not all of them airborne. Chuck Yeager was certainly among the fastest, and his determination to push through Mach 1--a feat that some had predicted would cause the destruction of any aircraft--makes him the book's guiding spirit.# Yet soon the focus shifts to the seven initial astronauts. Wolfe traces Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and Gus Grissom's embarrassing panic on the high seas (making the controversial claim that Grissom flooded his Liberty capsule by blowing the escape hatch too soon). The author also produces an admiring portrait of John Glenn's apple-pie heroism and selfless dedication. By the time Wolfe concludes with a return to Yeager and his late-career exploits, the narrative's epic proportions and literary merits are secure.

1591,Friedrich Nietzsche,Beyond Good and Evil,"#Friedrich Nietzsche's #Beyond Good and Evil #is translated from the German by R.J. Hollingdale with an introduction by Michael Tanner in Penguin Classics.###Beyond Good and Evil# confirmed Nietzsche's position as the towering European philosopher of his age. The work dramatically rejects the tradition of Western thought with its notions of truth and God, good and evil. Nietzsche demonstrates that the Christian world is steeped in a false piety and infected with a 'slave morality'. With wit and energy, he turns from this critique to a philosophy that celebrates the present and demands that the individual imposes their own 'will to power' upon the world.###This edition includes a commentary on the text by the translator and Michael Tanner's introduction, which explains some of the more abstract passages in #Beyond Good and Evil#.###Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre, was considerable.###If you enjoyed #Beyond Good and Evil #you might like Nietzsche's #Thus Spoke Zarathustra#, also available in Penguin Classics.###""One of the greatest books of a very great thinker."" —Michael Tanner","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'European Literature', 'German Literature', 'Psychology', 'Religion', 'Literature', '19th Century', 'Philosophy', 'Theory', 'History', 'Literature']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388607391l/12321.jpg,4.02,240 pages,(first published 1886),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12321.Beyond_Good_and_Evil,12321

So when he dies, far too young, of a mysterious illness her mother can barely speak about, June's world is turned upside down. But Finn's death brings a surprise acquaintance into June's life—someone who will help her to heal, and to question what she thinks she knows about Finn, her family, and even her own heart. ###At Finn's funeral, June notices a strange man lingering just beyond the crowd. A few days later, she receives a package in the mail. Inside is a beautiful teapot she recognizes from Finn's apartment, and a note from Toby, the stranger, asking for an opportunity to meet. As the two begin to spend time together, June realizes she's not the only one who misses Finn, and if she can bring herself to trust this unexpected friend, he just might be the one she needs the most. ###An emotionally charged coming-of-age novel, #Tell the Wolves I'm Home# is a tender story of love lost and found, an unforgettable portrait of the way compassion can make us whole again.","['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Young Adult', 'Coming Of Age', 'LGBT', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Book Club']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1335450415l/12875258.jpg,4.03,360 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12875258-tell-the-wolves-i-m-home,12875258

1629,Stephen King,Doctor Sleep,"#Stephen King returns to the characters and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, The Shining, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance (the boy protagonist of The Shining) and the very special 12-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.###On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless - mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky 12-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the ""steam"" that children with the ""shining"" produce when they are slowly tortured to death.###Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant ""shining"" power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes ""Doctor Sleep.""###Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan's own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra's soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of hyper-devoted fans of The Shining and wildly satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.","['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Paranormal', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Supernatural', 'Mystery', 'Suspense', 'Adult']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1510335480l/16130549._SY475_.jpg,4.12,531 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130549-doctor-sleep,16130549

Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.###Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night.

But those 12 years contained some of the most catastrophic events Western civilization has ever known.#No other powerful empire ever bequeathed such mountains of evidence about its birth and destruction as the Third Reich. When the bitter war was over, and before the Nazis could destroy their files, the Allied demand for unconditional surrender produced an almost hour-by-hour record of the nightmare empire built by Adolph Hitler. This record included the testimony of Nazi leaders and of concentration camp inmates, the diaries of officials, transcripts of secret conferences, army orders, private letters—all the vast paperwork behind Hitler's drive to conquer the world.#The famed foreign correspondent and historian William L. Shirer, who had watched and reported on the Nazis since 1925, spent five and a half years sifting through this massive documentation. The result is a monumental study that has been widely acclaimed as the definitive record of one of the most frightening chapters in the history of mankind.#This worldwide bestseller has been acclaimed as the definitive book on Nazi Germany; it is a classic work.#The accounts of how the United States got involved and how Hitler used Mussolini and Japan are astonishing, and the coverage of the war-from Germany's early successes to her eventual defeat-is must reading","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'War', 'World War II', 'War', 'Politics', 'Cultural', 'Germany', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'World War II', 'Holocaust', 'Military', 'Military History']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331223772l/767171.jpg,4.19,1614 pages,(first published October 17th 1960),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767171.The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Third_Reich,767171

Kuang,The Poppy War,"#A ""Best of May"" Science Fiction and Fantasy pick by Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Audible, The Verge, SyFy Wire, and Kirkus###“I have no doubt this will end up being the best fantasy debut of the year [...] I have absolutely no doubt that [Kuang’s] name will be up there with the likes of Robin Hobb and N.K. Jemisin.” -- Booknest###A brilliantly imaginative talent makes her exciting debut with this epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history of China’s twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic, in the tradition of Ken Liu’s #Grace of Kings# and N.K. Jemisin’s Inheritance Trilogy.###When Rin aced the Keju—the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies—it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising.###But surprises aren’t always good.###Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.###For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .###Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Adult', 'Historical', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'War', 'Fantasy', 'Magic']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1515691735l/35068705.jpg,4.15,545 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068705-the-poppy-war,35068705

1655,Willa Cather,O Pioneers!,"#O Pioneers!# (1913) was Willa Cather's first great novel, and to many it remains her unchallenged masterpiece. No other work of fiction so faithfully conveys both the sharp physical realities and the mythic sweep of the transformation of the American frontier—and the transformation of the people who settled it. Cather's heroine is Alexandra Bergson, who arrives on the wind-blasted prairie of Hanover, Nebraska, as a girl and grows up to make it a prosperous farm. But this archetypal success story is darkened by loss, and Alexandra's devotion to the land may come at the cost of love itself.###At once a sophisticated pastoral and a prototype for later feminist novels, #O Pioneers!# is a work in which triumph is inextricably enmeshed with tragedy, a story of people who do not claim a land so much as they submit to it and, in the process, become greater than they were.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Literature', 'American', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Westerns', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Classics', 'Classic Literature']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388956566l/140963.jpg,3.88,159 pages,(first published 1913),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140963.O_Pioneers_,140963

1657,Marcel Proust,In Search of Lost Time,"#On the surface a traditional ""Bildungsroman"" describing the narrator’s journey of self-discovery, this huge and complex book is also a panoramic and richly comic portrait of France in the author’s lifetime, and a profound meditation on the nature of art, love, time, memory and death. But for most readers it is the characters of the novel who loom the largest: Swann and Odette, Monsieur de Charlus, Morel, the Duchesse de Guermantes, Françoise, Saint-Loup and so many others — Giants, as the author calls them, immersed in Time. ""In Search of Lost Time"" is a novel in seven volumes. The novel began to take shape in 1909. Proust continued to work on it until his final illness in the autumn of 1922 forced him to break off. Proust established the structure early on, but even after volumes were initially finished he kept adding new material, and edited one volume after another for publication. The last three of the seven volumes contain oversights and fragmentary or unpolished passages as they existed in draft form at the death of the author; the publication of these parts was overseen by his brother Robert.###For this authoritative English-language edition, D. J. Enright has revised the late Terence Kilmartin’s acclaimed reworking of C. K. Scott Moncrieff’s translation to take into account the new definitive French editions of À la recherche du temps perdu (the final volume of these new editions was published by the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade in 1989).","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Cultural', 'France', 'Literature', 'Philosophy', 'European Literature', 'French Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction', 'Classics', 'Classic Literature']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1657567516l/18796._SX318_.jpg,4.35,4211 pages,(first published 1927),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18796.In_Search_of_Lost_Time,18796

As the most beautiful girl in Gavaldon, Sophie has dreamed of being kidnapped into an enchanted world her whole life. With her pink dresses, glass slippers, and devotion to good deeds, she knows she’ll earn top marks at the School for Good and graduate a storybook princess. Meanwhile Agatha, with her shapeless black frocks, wicked pet cat, and dislike of nearly everyone, seems a natural fit for the School for Evil.###But when the two girls are swept into the Endless Woods, they find their fortunes reversed—Sophie’s dumped in the School for Evil to take Uglification, Death Curses, and Henchmen Training, while Agatha finds herself in the School For Good, thrust amongst handsome princes and fair maidens for classes in Princess Etiquette and Animal Communication.

When your son can't look you in the eye...does that mean he's guilty?
###Jacob Hunt is a teen with Asperger's syndrome. He's hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, though he is brilliant in many ways. But he has a special focus on one subject - forensic analysis. A police scanner in his room clues him in to crime scenes, and he's always showing up and telling the cops what to do. And he's usually right.###But when Jacob's small hometown is rocked by a terrible murder, law enforcement comes to him. Jacob's behaviors are hallmark Asperger's, but they look a lot like guilt to the local police. Suddenly the Hunt family, who only want to fit in, are directly in the spotlight. For Jacob's mother, Emma, it's a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family. For his brother, Theo, it's another indication why nothing is normal because of Jacob.###And over this small family, the soul-searing question looms: #
Did Jacob commit murder?

1679,Charles Dickens,Hard Times,"#""My satire is against those who see figures and averages, and nothing else,"" proclaimed Charles Dickens in explaining the theme of this classic novel. Published in 1854, the story concerns one Thomas Gradgrind, a ""fanatic of the demonstrable fact,"" who raises his children, Tom and Louisa, in a stifling and arid atmosphere of grim practicality.###Without a moral compass to guide them, the children sink into lives of desperation and despair, played out against the grim background of Coketown, a wretched community shadowed by an industrial behemoth. Louisa falls into a loveless marriage with Josiah Bouderby, a vulgar banker, while the unscrupulous Tom, totally lacking in principle, becomes a thief who frames an innocent man for his crime. Witnessing the degradation and downfall of his children, Gradgrind realizes that his own misguided principles have ruined their lives.###Considered Dickens' harshest indictment of mid-19th-century industrial practices and their dehumanizing effects, this novel offers a fascinating tapestry of Victorian life, filled with the richness of detail, brilliant characterization, and passionate social concern that typify the novelist's finest creations.###Of Dickens' work, the eminent Victorian critic John Ruskin had this to say: ""He is entirely right in his main drift and purpose in every book he has written; and all of them, but especially Hard Times, should be studied with close and earnest care by persons interested in social questions.""","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Literature', '19th Century', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Victorian', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'European Literature', 'British Literature', 'Classics', 'Classic Literature', 'Academic', 'School']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1631982866l/5344._SY475_.jpg,3.54,353 pages,(first published 1854),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5344.Hard_Times,5344

1697,Eça de Queirós,Os Maias,"#Biblioteca Ulisseia de Autores Portugueses #15###Os Maias# é uma das obras mais conhecidas do escritor português Eça de Queiroz. O livro foi publicado no Porto em 1888. A acção de #Os Maias# passa-se em Lisboa, na segunda metade do século XIX, e apresenta-nos a história de três gerações da família Maia. A acção inicia-se no Outono de 1875, quando Afonso da Maia, nobre e pobre proprietário, se instala no Ramalhete com o neto recém formado em Medicina. Neste momento faz-se uma longa descrição da casa - ""O Ramalhete,"" cujo nome tem origem num painel de azulejos com um ramo de girassóis, e não em algo fresco ou campestre, tal como o nome nos remete a pensar. Afonso da Maia era o personagem mais simpático do romance e aquele que o autor mais valorizou, pois não se lhe conhecem defeitos. É um homem de carácter, culto e requintado nos gostos. Em jovem aderiu aos ideais do Liberalismo e foi obrigado, por seu pai, a sair de casa e a instalar-se em Inglaterra. Após o pai falecer regressa a Lisboa para casar com Maria Eduarda Runa, mas pouco tempo depois escolhe o exílio por razões de ordem política. Há em #Os Maias# um retrato da Lisboa da epóca. Carlos, que mora na Rua das Janelas Verdes, caminha com frequência até ao Rossio (embora, por vezes, vá a cavalo ou de carruagem). Algumas das lojas citadas no livro ainda existem - a Casa Havaneza, no Chiado, por exemplo. É possível seguir os diferentes percursos de Carlos ou do Ega pelas suas da Baixa lisboeta, ainda que algumas tenham mudado de nome. No final do livro, quando Carlos volta a Lisboa muitos anos depois, somos levados a ver as novidades - a Avenida da Liberdade, que substituiu o Passeio Público, e que é descrita como uma coisa nova, e feia pela sua novidade, exactamente como nos anos 70 se falava das casas de emigrante. O romance veicula sobre o país uma perspectiva muito derrotista, muito pessimista. Tirando a natureza (o Tejo, Sintra, Santa Olávia...), é tudo uma choldra ignóbil. Predomina uma visão de estrangeirado, de quem só valoriza as civilizações superiores - da França e Inglaterra, principalmente. Os políticos são mesquinhos, ignorantes ou corruptos (Gouvarinho, Sousa Neto...); os homens das Letras sao boémios e dissolutos, retrógrados ou distantes da realidade concreta (Alencar, Ega...: lembre-se o que se passou no Sarau do Teatro da Trindade); os jornalistas boémios e venais (Palma...); os homens do desporto não conseguem organizar uma corrida de cavalos, pois não há hipódromo à altura, nem cavalos, nem cavaleiros, as pessoas não vestem como o evento exigia, as senhoras traziam vestidos de missa. Para cúmulo de tudo isto, os protagonistas acabam vencidos da vida. Apesar de ser isto referido no fim do livro, pode-se ver que ainda há alguma esperanca implícita, nas passagens em que Carlos da Maia e João da Ega dizem que o apetite humano é a causa de todos os seus problemas e que portanto nunca mais terão apetites, mas logo a seguir dizem que lhes está a apetecer um ""prato de paio com ervilhas,"" ou quando dizem que a pressa não leva a nada e que a vida deve ser levada com calma mas começam a correr para apanhar o americano (eléctrico). Mais do que crítica de costumes, o romance mostra-nos um país - sobretudo Lisboa - que se dissolve, incapaz de se regenerar. Quando o autor escreve mais tarde #A Cidade e as Serras#, expõe uma atitude muito mais construtiva: o protagonista regenera-se pela descoberta das raízes rurais ancestrais não atingidas pela degradação da civilização, num movimento inverso ao que predomina n'#Os Maias#.","['Classics', 'European Literature', 'Portuguese Literature', 'Fiction', 'Cultural', 'Portugal', 'Romance', 'Academic', 'School', 'Literature', 'Literature', '19th Century', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362526641l/1249630.jpg,4.01,681 pages,(first published 1888),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1249630.Os_Maias,1249630

What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians—it is a place of lost cities and seas, lovers who pass notes under doors and across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. Zachary learns of those who have sacrificed much to protect this realm, relinquishing their sight and their tongues to preserve this archive, and also of those who are intent on its destruction. Together with Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired protector of the place, and Dorian, a handsome, barefoot man with shifting alliances, Zachary travels the twisting tunnels, darkened stairwells, crowded ballrooms, and sweetly soaked shores of this magical world, discovering his purpose—in both the mysterious book and in his own life.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Adult', 'Romance', 'LGBT', 'Audiobook', 'Writing', 'Books About Books', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'LGBT', 'Queer']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1617715077l/43575115._SY475_.jpg,3.86,498 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43575115-the-starless-sea,43575115

1724,Thomas Paine,Common Sense,"#Among the most influential authors and reformers of his age, Thomas Paine (1737–1809) was born in England but went on to play an important role in both the American and French Revolutions. In 1774, he emigrated to America where, for a time, he helped to edit the #Pennsylvania Magazine#. On January 10, 1776, he published his pamphlet #Common Sense,# a persuasive argument for the colonies' political and economic separation from Britain.###Common Sense# cites the evils of monarchy, accuses the British government of inflicting economic and social injustices upon the colonies, and points to the absurdity of an island attempting to rule a continent. Credited by George Washington as having changed the minds of many of his countrymen, the document sold over 500,000 copies within a few months.###Today, #Common Sense# remains a landmark document in the struggle for freedom, distinguished not only by Paine's ideas but also by its clear and passionate presentation. Designed to ignite public opinion against autocratic rule, the pamphlet offered a careful balance between imagination and judgment, and appropriate language and expression to fit the subject. It immediately found a receptive audience, heartened Washington's despondent army, and foreshadowed much of the phrasing and substance of the Declaration of Independence.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Philosophy', 'Politics', 'North American Hi...', 'American History', 'Writing', 'Essays', 'Historical', 'Military History', 'American Revolution', 'Politics', 'Political Science']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309209451l/161744.jpg,3.99,104 pages,(first published 1776),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/161744.Common_Sense,161744

1742,Ernesto Sabato,El túnel,"#Breve e intensa novela publicada en 1948, este logrado fruto de la denominada ""literatura existencial"" le dio a su autor un reconocimiento que traspasó las fronteras nacionales. Para quien todavía no la leyó, #El túnel# es la mejor introducción al universo prodigioso de Ernesto Sábato; para quien la conoce, un clásico de las letras del continente, una historia sobre el drama del hombre arrojado en el sinsentido más doloroso: la conciencia de la nada. ##El narrador describe una historia de amor y muerte en la que muestra la soledad del individuo contemporáneo. No están ausentes de esta trama policial y de suspenso, la locura y la increíble reflexión del protagonista, el pintor Juan Pablo Castel, debatiéndose por comprender las causas que lo arrastraron a matar a la mujer que amaba, María Iribarne, y que era su única vía de salvación. En este alucinante drama de la vida interior, seres intrincados en la bestial búsqueda de comprensión ceden a la mentira, la hipocresía y los celos desmedidos hasta el crimen más inexplicable. Aventura amorosa, aventura onírica, aventura del ser que dan testimonio de un asesinato, de cierta memoria culpable y de una valiente introspección. ##Técnicamente perfecta y de lectura apasionante, #El túnel# excede el negativismo ácido de Sartre y la frenética huida hacia el vacío que plantea #El extranjero# de Camus, pero tiene de esos dos maestros literarios la impronta genial que hace de la escritura una radiografía del alma atormentada.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'European Literature', 'Spanish Literature', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Cultural', 'Latin American', 'Literature', 'Latin American Literature', 'Academic', 'School', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Thriller']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1170423850l/53447._SY475_.jpg,4.03,158 pages,(first published 1948),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53447.El_t_nel,53447

His agenda in this tome, which was first published in 1978 but didn't become a bestseller until 1983, is to reconcile the psychoanalytic tradition with the conflicting cultural currents roiling the 70s. In the spirit of Me-Decade individualism and libertinism, he celebrates self-actualization as life's highest purpose and flirts with the notions of open marriage and therapeutic sex between patient and analyst. But because he is attuned to the nascent conservative backlash against the therapeutic worldview, Peck also cites Gospel passages, recruits psychotherapy to the cause of traditional religion (he even convinces a patient to sign up for divinity school) and insists that problems must be overcome through suffering, discipline and hard work (with a therapist.) Often departing from the cerebral and rationalistic bent of Freudian discourse for a mystical, Jungian tone more compatible with New Age spirituality, Peck writes of psychotherapy as an exercise in ""love"" and ""spiritual growth,"" asserts that ""our unconscious is God"" and affirms his belief in miracles, reincarnation and telepathy. Peck's synthesis of such clashing elements (he even throws in a little thermodynamics) is held together by a warm and lucid discussion of psychiatric principles and moving accounts of his own patients' struggles and breakthroughs.

1770,Malcolm Gladwell,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,"#Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made #The Tipping Point# a classic, #Blink# changes the way you'll understand every decision you make. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.###Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? ###In #Blink# we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing"" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.","['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Business', 'Self Help', 'Science', 'Sociology', 'Audiobook', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Leadership']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1440763417l/40102._SX318_.jpg,3.96,296 pages,(first published January 11th 2005),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink,40102

Another early piece, ‘The Outsider’ – a tragic and emotive evocation of loneliness and desolation – follows a man’s escape from his castle in a desperate search for human contact, but the loathsome truth he discovers destroys his mind.###In later tales, such as the iconic ‘The Call of Cthulhu’ and ‘The Whisperer in Darkness’, Lovecraft reaches into the cosmos, bridging the divide between horror and science fiction. The extra-terrestrial ‘gods’ and cursed histories that would emerge from these stories now form the cornerstones of Lovecraft’s unique mythology: the Cthulhu Mythos. This fictional universe, built in large part by his friend and most ardent supporter August Derleth, has in the years since been reimagined in myriad forms, and continues to act as a haunted playground for countless illustrators, fans and authors.###This edition, based on its sister limited edition, marries Lovecraft’s best-known fiction with two modern masters of the macabre, the acclaimed artist Dan Hillier and author Alan Moore. In his beautifully crafted new preface, Moore finds Lovecraft at once at odds with and integral to the time in which he lived: ‘the improbable embodiment of an estranged world in transition’. Yet, despite his prejudices and parochialisms, he ‘possessed a voice and a perspective both unique in modern literature’.###Hillier’s six mesmerising, portal-like illustrations embrace the alien realities that lurk among the gambrel roofs of Lovecraft’s landscapes. By splicing Victorian portraits and lithographs with cosmic and Lovecraftian symbolism, each piece – like the stories themselves – pulls apart the familiar to reveal what lies beneath.###The edition itself shimmers with Lovecraft’s ‘unknown colours’, bound in purple and greens akin to both the ocean depths and mysteries from outer space. The cover is embossed with a mystical design by Hillier, while a monstrous eye stares blankly from the slipcase.###Content:##1. Dagon##2. The Statement of Randolph Carter##3.

1786,Joseph Conrad,Lord Jim,"#Jim, a young British seaman, becomes first mate on the Patna, a ship full of pilgrims travelling to Mecca for the hajj. When the ship starts rapidly taking on water and disaster seems imminent, Jim joins his captain and other crew members in abandoning the ship and its passengers. A few days later, they are picked up by a British ship. However, the Patna and its passengers are later also saved, and the reprehensible actions of the crew are exposed. The other participants evade the judicial court of inquiry, leaving Jim to the court alone. He is publicly censured for this action and the novel follows his later attempts at coming to terms with his past. The novel is counted as one of 100 best books of the 20th century.###Joseph Conrad (1857-1924), was a Polish author who wrote in English after settling in England. Conrad is regarded as one of the greatest novelists in English, though he did not speak the language fluently until he was in his twenties. He wrote stories and novels, often with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an indifferent world. He was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English tragic sensibility into English literature.###Contents: ###Lord Jim###Memoirs & Letters:###A Personal Record; or Some Reminiscences###The Mirror of the Sea###Notes on Life & Letters###Biography & Critical Essays:###Joseph Conrad (A Biography) by Hugh Walpole###Joseph Conrad by John Albert Macy###A Conrad Miscellany by John Albert Macy###Joseph Conrad by Virginia Woolf","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Adventure', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'European Literature', 'British Literature', 'Literature', 'English Literature', 'Classics', 'Classic Literature', 'Literature', '20th Century']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1372366969l/12194._SX318_.jpg,3.62,455 pages,(first published 1899),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12194.Lord_Jim,12194

Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister--the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms. ## Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki--whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.##""","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Fantasy', 'Dragons', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Novels', 'Adult']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1339340118l/12177850.jpg,4.60,5216 pages,(first published 2000),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12177850-a-song-of-ice-and-fire,12177850

Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each other’s pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years, in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Kenya.###We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapist’s couch in New York City, confronting her long-standing compulsion to steal. Later, we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then as a runaway living in Naples, then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We plunge into the hidden yearnings and disappointments of her uncle, an art historian stuck in a dead marriage, who travels to Naples to extract Sasha from the city’s demimonde and experiences an epiphany of his own while staring at a sculpture of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Museo Nazionale. We meet Bennie Salazar at the melancholy nadir of his adult life—divorced, struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son, listening to a washed-up band in the basement of a suburban house—and then revisit him in 1979, at the height of his youth, shy and tender, reveling in San Francisco’s punk scene as he discovers his ardor for rock and roll and his gift for spotting talent. We learn what became of his high school gang—who thrived and who faltered—and we encounter Lou Kline, Bennie’s catastrophically careless mentor, along with the lovers and children left behind in the wake of Lou’s far-flung sexual conquests and meteoric rise and fall. ###A Visit from the Goon Squad# is a book about the interplay of time and music, about survival, about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates. In a breathtaking array of styles and tones ranging from tragedy to satire to PowerPoint, Egan captures the undertow of self-destruction that we all must either master or succumb to; the basic human hunger for redemption; and the universal tendency to reach for both—and escape the merciless progress of time—in the transporting realms of art and music. Sly, startling, exhilarating work from one of our boldest writers.","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Music', 'Short Stories', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Literature', 'Book Club', 'Adult']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356844046l/7331435.jpg,3.68,274 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7331435-a-visit-from-the-goon-squad,7331435

Aged four, she is betrothed to Arthur, Prince of Wales, and is raised to be Queen of England. She is never in doubt that it is her destiny to rule that far-off, wet, cold land.#Her faith is tested when her prospective father-in-law greets her arrival in her new country with a great insult; Arthur seems little better than a boy; the food is strange and the customs coarse. Slowly she adapts to the first Tudor court, and life as Arthur’s wife grows ever more bearable.#But when the studious young man dies, she is left to make her own future: how can she now be queen, and found a dynasty? Only by marrying Arthur’s young brother, the sunny but spoilt Henry. His father and grandmother are against it; her powerful parents prove little use.

1838,Wally Lamb,The Hour I First Believed,"#Wally Lamb's two previous novels, #She's Come Undone# and #I Know This Much Is True,# struck a chord with readers. They responded to the intensely introspective nature of the books, and to their lively narrative styles and biting humor. #In The Hour I First Believed, Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth, psychology, family history stretching back many generations, and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life. The result is an extraordinary tour de force, at once a meditation on the human condition and an unflinching yet compassionate evocation of character.#When forty-seven-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife, Maureen, a school nurse, move to Littleton, Colorado, they both get jobs at Columbine High School. In April 1999, Caelum returns home to Three Rivers, Connecticut, to be with his aunt who has just had a stroke. But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a carefully premeditated, murderous rampage. Miraculously she survives, but at a cost: she is unable to recover from the trauma. Caelum and Maureen flee Colorado and return to an illusion of safety at the Quirk family farm in Three Rivers. But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues. #While Maureen fights to regain her sanity, Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house. The colorful and intriguing story they recount spans five generations of Quirk family ancestors, from the Civil War era to Caelum's own troubled childhood. Piece by piece, Caelum reconstructs the lives of the women and men whose legacy he bears. Unimaginable secrets emerge; long-buried fear, anger, guilt, and grief rise to the surface. #As Caelum grapples with unexpected and confounding revelations from the past, he also struggles to fashion a future out of the ashes of tragedy. His personal quest for meaning and faith becomes a mythic journey that is at the same time quintessentially contemporary -- and American.#The Hour I First Believed is a profound and heart-rending work of fiction. Wally Lamb proves himself a virtuoso storyteller, assembling a variety of voices and an ensemble of characters rich enough to evoke all of humanity.","['Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Literary Fiction', 'Drama', 'Novels', 'Book Club', 'Audiobook']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438893201l/3086160._SY475_.jpg,3.82,740 pages,(first published October 28th 2008),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3086160-the-hour-i-first-believed,3086160

She finds women friends and painful memories of the Clan she left behind, and meets Ranec, the dark-skinned, magnetic master carver of ivory, whom she cannot refuse--inciting Jondalar to a fierce jealousy that he tries to control by avoiding her. Unfamiliar with the ways of the Others, Ayla misunderstands, and thinking Jondalar no longer loves her, she turns more to Ranec. Throughout the icy winter the tension mounts, but warming weather will bring the great mammoth hunt and the mating rituals of the Summer Meeting, when Ayla must choose to remain with Ranec and the Mamutoi, or to follow Jondalar on a long journey into an unknown future.","['Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'Prehistoric', 'Adventure', 'Adult', 'Novels', 'Audiobook']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388257676l/49824.jpg,3.93,688 pages,(first published 1985),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49824.The_Mammoth_Hunters,49824

To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.#Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down, impossible to forget.Winner of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize","['Nonfiction', 'Crime', 'True Crime', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Biography', 'Classics', 'History', 'Literature', 'Mystery', 'Literature', 'American', 'Writing', 'Journalism']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1325755176l/12468.jpg,4.06,1056 pages,(first published October 30th 1979),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12468.The_Executioner_s_Song,12468

Yet there are moments of exquisite tenderness in these troubled lives. Georgette, the transvestite who falls in love with a callous hoodlum; Tralala, the conniving prostitute who plumbs the depths of sexual degradation; and Harry, the strike leader who hides his true desires behind a boorish masculinity, are unforgettable creations. #Last Exit to Brooklyn# was banned by British courts in 1967, a decision that was reversed the following year with the help of a number of writers and critics including Anthony Burgess and Frank Kermode.###Hubert Selby, Jr. (1928-2004) was born in Brooklyn, New York. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school and went to sea with the merchant marines. While at sea he was diagnosed with lung disease. With no other way to make a living, he decided to try writing: 'I knew the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer.' In 1964 he completed his first book, #Last Exit to Brooklyn#, which has since become a cult classic. In 1966, it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK. His other books include #The Room#, #The Demon#, #Requiem for a Dream#, #The Willow Tree# and #Waiting Period#. In 2000, #Requiem for a Dream# was adapted into a film starring Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, and directed by Darren Aronofsky.###'#Last Exit to Brooklyn# will explode like a rusty hellish bombshell over America, and still be eagerly read in 100 years'##Allen Ginsberg###'An urgent tickertape from hell'##Spectator","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'New York', 'Literature', 'American', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Thriller', 'Dark', 'Literature', '20th Century']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362815242l/50275.jpg,3.92,290 pages,(first published 1964),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50275.Last_Exit_to_Brooklyn,50275

From drugging him as he sleeps to dropping the ceiling on his head, these figures of Irish myth make Trellis pay dearly for his bad writing.###Hilariously funny and inventive, At Swim-Two-Birds has influenced generations of writers, opening up new possibilities for what can be done in fiction. It is a true masterpiece of Irish literature.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'Cultural', 'Ireland', 'European Literature', 'Irish Literature', 'Novels', 'Humor', 'Literature', 'Fantasy', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Literary Fiction']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1584237539l/97333._SY475_.jpg,3.87,239 pages,(first published 1939),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97333.At_Swim_Two_Birds,97333

1876,Mark Manson,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,"#Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738###In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.###For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. #The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k# is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.###Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.###There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, #The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k# is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.","['Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Audiobook', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Business', 'Humor', 'Adult', 'Health', 'Mental Health']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465761302l/28257707.jpg,3.91,212 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck,28257707

Salinger,"Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters & Seymour: An Introduction","#This book contains two separate stories: ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters"" is the first, and ""Seymour: An Introduction"" is the second.###""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters"" is a story about the Glass family, narrated by Buddy, the second oldest brother. Buddy is attending his brother Seymour's wedding to a gal named Muriel, but he's on Army leave during active duty in World War II. At the wedding, everyone is stunned when Seymour does not show up.###The action of the story picks up when several characters end up carpooling together following the failed wedding. The others (the Matron of Honor and her husband, and a couple of stragglers) are talking about Seymour and the disappointment of his not showing up, and Buddy never tells them that he is secretly Seymour's brother, so they talk more openly with him than they otherwise would.###They criticize Seymour and speculate about his character flaws and deficiencies, but Buddy finds their assessments quite judgmental and biased. He then decides to tell the car who he really is, shaming them for their loose criticisms.###He finds Seymour's journal, and he discovers a strange message from their sister Boo Boo for Seymour on their bathroom mirror: ""Raise high the roof beam, carpenters. Like Ares comes the bridegroom/ taller far than a tall man."" This is a fragment from the Greek poet Sappho.###""Seymour: An Introduction"" is a kind of elegy for Seymour from Buddy, told in the form of an introduction to the reader.

1902,Doris Kearns Goodwin,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,"#Winner of the Lincoln Prize###Acclaimed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin illuminates Lincoln's political genius in this highly original work, as the one-term congressman and prairie lawyer rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals of national reputation to become president.###On May 18, 1860, William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry.###Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires.###It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war.###We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through.###This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation's history.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'North American Hi...', 'American History', 'Military History', 'Civil War', 'Politics', 'Presidents', 'Leadership', 'Historical', 'Audiobook']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1160801826l/2199.jpg,4.26,916 pages,(first published October 25th 2005),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2199.Team_of_Rivals,2199

Thrust among those who see her as a symbol of a monstrous kingdom, she barely knows who she is without the veil of the Maiden. But what she does know is that nothing is as dangerous to her as him. The Dark One. The Prince of Atlantia. He wants her to fight him, and that’s one order she’s more than happy to obey.

Ones that could expose her to unimaginable pleasure and unfathomable pain. Plans that will force her to look beyond everything she thought she knew about herself—about him. Plans that could bind their lives together in unexpected ways that neither kingdom is prepared for. And she’s far too reckless, too hungry, to resist the temptation.###A Secret…###But unrest has grown in Atlantia as they await the return of their Prince. Whispers of war have become stronger, and Poppy is at the very heart of it all. The King wants to use her to send a message. The Descenters want her dead. The wolven are growing more unpredictable.

During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was ""collected."" But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.###Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros—a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose—as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster. Suddenly burdened with a staggering responsibility, Erasmas finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of his world—as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of the planet . . . and beyond.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Philosophy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Novels', 'Science Fiction', 'Cyberpunk', 'Science', 'Mathematics']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1488349209l/2845024._SX318_.jpg,4.17,937 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2845024-anathem,2845024

"" So begins a new epilogue, illustrating how Columbine became the template for nearly two decades of ""spectacle murders."" It is a false script, seized upon by a generation of new killers. In the wake of Newtown, Aurora, and Virginia Tech, the imperative to understand the crime that sparked this plague grows more urgent every year.###What really happened April 20, 1999? The horror left an indelible stamp on the American psyche, but most of what we ""know"" is wrong. It wasn't about jocks, Goths, or the Trench Coat Mafia.

Cullen paints raw portraits of two polar opposite killers.

1987,Alan Moore,From Hell,"#""I shall tell you where we are. We're in the most extreme and utter region of the human mind. A dim, subconscious underworld. A radiant abyss where men meet themselves. Hell, Netley. We're in Hell."" ###Having proved himself peerless in the arena of reinterpreting superheroes, Alan Moore turned his ever-incisive eye to the squalid, enigmatic world of Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders of 1888. Weighing in at 576 pages, #From Hell# is certainly the most epic of Moore's works and remarkably and is possibly his finest effort yet in a career punctuated by such glorious highlights as #Watchmen# and #V for Vendetta#. Going beyond the myriad existing theories, which range from the sublime to the ridiculous, Moore presents an ingenious take on the slaughter. His Ripper's brutal activities are the epicentre of a conspiracy involving the very heart of the British Establishment, including the Freemasons and The Royal Family. A popular claim, which is transformed through Moore's exquisite and thoroughly gripping vision, of the Ripper crimes being the womb from which the 20th century, so enmeshed in the celebrity culture of violence, received its shocking, visceral birth. ###Bolstered by meticulous research that encompasses a wide spectrum of Ripper studies and myths and coupled with his ability to evoke sympathies in such monstrous characters, Moore has created perhaps the finest examination of the Ripper legacy, observing far beyond society's obsessive need to expose Evil's visage. Ultimately, as Moore observes, Jack's identity and his actions are inconsequential to the manner in which society embraced the Fear: ""It's about us. It's about our minds and how they dance. Jack mirrors our hysterias. Faceless, he is the receptacle for each new social panic."" ###Eddie Campbell's stunning black and white artwork, replete with a scratchy, dirty sheen, is perfectly matched to the often-unshakeable intensity of Moore's writing. Between them, each murder is rendered in horrifying detail, providing the book's most unnerving scenes, made more so in uncomfortable, yet lyrical moments as when the villain embraces an eviscerated corpse, craving understanding; pleading that they ""are wed in legend, inextricable within eternity"". ###Though technically a comic, the term hardly begins to describe #From Hell#'s inimitable grandeur and finesse, as it takes the medium to fresh heights of ingenuity and craftsmanship. Moore and Campbell's autopsy on the emaciated corpse of the Ripper myth has divulged a deeply disturbing yet undeniably captivating masterpiece. —#Danny Graydon","['Sequential Art', 'Graphic Novels', 'Sequential Art', 'Comics', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Comics', 'Comic Book', 'Mystery', 'Historical']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1509277098l/23529._SX318_.jpg,4.18,576 pages,(first published 1999),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23529.From_Hell,23529

Genuinely tragic and comic by turns, it attains a complexity of theme and a precision of thought new to comics and rare in any medium. #Maus# ties together two powerful stories: Vladek's harrowing tale of survival against all odds, delineating the paradox of daily life in the death camps, and the author's account of his tortured relationship with his aging father.

But perhaps his greatest miracle was the healing of people's souls, - the forgiveness of sin. Jesus offers us that same miracle on the same terms- sincere repentance. In The Miracle of Forgiveness, President Spencer W Kimball gives a penetrating explanation of repentance and forgiveness and clarifies their implications for Church members. His in-depth approach shows that the need for forgiveness is universal; portrays the various facets of repentance, and emphasizes some of the more serious errors, particularly sexual ones, which afflict both modern society and Church members. Most important, he illuminates his message with the brightness of hope that even those who have gone grievously astray may find the way back to peace and security.

Less then twenty-four hours later, only one of those Navy SEALs remained alive. #### This is the story of fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of Operation Redwing, and the desperate battle in the mountains that led, ultimately, to the largest loss of life in Navy SEAL history.

Over the next four days, badly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell fought off six al Qaeda assassins who were sent to finish him, then crawled for seven miles through the mountains before he was taken in by a Pashtun tribe, who risked everything to protect him from the encircling Taliban killers.#### A six-foot-five-inch Texan, Leading Petty Officer Luttrell takes us, blow-by-blow, through the brutal training of America's warrior elite and the relentless rites of passage required by the Navy SEALs. He transports us to a monstrous battle fought in the desolate peaks of Afghanistan, where the beleaguered American team plummeted headlong a thousand feet down a mountain as they fought back through flying shale and rocks.

The people of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii fascinate Ayla. Their clothes, customs, artifacts, even their homes—formed in great cliffs of vertical limestone—are a source of wonder to her. And in the woman Zelandoni, the spiritual leader of the Ninth Cave (and the one who initiated Jondalar into the Gift of Pleasure), she meets a fellow healer with whom to share her knowledge and skills.#But as Ayla and Jondalar prepare for the formal mating at the Summer Meeting, there are difficulties. Not all the Zelandonii are welcoming. Some fear Ayla’s unfamiliar ways and abhor her relationship with those they call flatheads and she calls Clan.

2084,Yuval Noah Harari,Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow,"#Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity’s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods.##Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.#What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.#With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future.

A successful painter and sculptor, he lives quietly with his wife, Melanie, and their two young daughters, in an affluent beach town in California. Some say he’s a fake and a con man, while others see him as a genuine visionary.###But Francis has a very dark past, with another identity and a very different set of values. When he crosses the Atlantic to his native Scotland, for the funeral of a murdered son he barely knew, his old Edinburgh community expects him to take bloody revenge. But as he confronts his previous life, all those friends and enemies – and, most alarmingly, his former self – Francis seems to have other ideas.###When Melanie discovers something gruesome in California, which indicates that her husband’s violent past might also be his psychotic present, things start to go very bad, very quickly. ###The Blade Artist# is an elegant, electrifying novel – ultra violent but curiously redemptive – and it marks the return of one of modern fiction’s most infamous, terrifying characters, the incendiary Francis Begbie from #Trainspotting#.","['Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'Contemporary', 'Cultural', 'Scotland', 'Dark', 'Suspense', 'Drama', 'Novels']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1453058010l/25870405.jpg,3.82,288 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25870405-the-blade-artist,25870405

Young Sam Gribley gets to the end of the block and keeps going--all the way to the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. There he sets up house in a huge hollowed-out tree, with a falcon and a weasel for companions and his wits as his tool for survival.

That is the question at the heart of #We Should All Be Feminists#, a personal, eloquently-argued essay—adapted from her much-viewed TEDx talk of the same name—by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the award-winning author of #Americanah# and #Half of a Yellow Sun#. ###With humor and levity, here Adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century—one rooted in inclusion and awareness. She shines a light not only on blatant discrimination, but also the more insidious, institutional behaviors that marginalize women around the world, in order to help readers of all walks of life better understand the often masked realities of sexual politics. Throughout, she draws extensively on her own experiences—in the U.S., in her native Nigeria, and abroad—offering an artfully nuanced explanation of why the gender divide is harmful for women and men, alike. ###Argued in the same observant, witty and clever prose that has made Adichie a bestselling novelist, here is one remarkable author’s exploration of what it means to be a woman today—and an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists.","['Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Writing', 'Essays', 'Audiobook', 'Politics', 'Womens', 'Cultural', 'Africa', 'Social Movements', 'Social Justice', 'Adult', 'Gender']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1430821222l/22738563.jpg,4.42,65 pages,(first published 2012),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22738563-we-should-all-be-feminists,22738563

2194,Christine M. Knight,Life Song,"#Overview: Mavis was born to be a songbird. Her parents named her after one, a bird with a distinctive song worthy of poetry. With her wings clipped by circumstance, Mavis spent six years of her life grounded and her dream of soaring flight almost forgotten. Unexpectedly, Mavis discovers she has a choice: accept a life that is ordinary or be among the one percent that shine. It is a long way to the top in the Australian music industry and more than a name needs to change in order to succeed. It is a gruelling challenge with exhausting demands and subtle traps for the uninitiated. Can Mavis make it? Can she build a better life for herself and her son? Can she have it all? Readership (ages 16+): Every generation that has faced life's challenges and who has tried to find the balance between career, parenthood, and having it all. The themes are discovery, triumphing against the odds, reinvention, disparate families, parenting, friendship, and the nature of love; themes that resonate with all ages. Editorial Review: Christine M Knight's second novel LIFE SONG is a joyfully triumphant confection that resonates with layers of interest. The core of this novel centres on Mavis Mills' resolve to be in charge of her life and captain of her creativity. It is a story that celebrates the power of belief in oneself and of friends and supporters. In terms of its chick-lit appeal, LIFE SONG ticks all the boxes. It is a blend of wry humour and vivid storytelling and the outcome is satisfying without being cloying. There is sizzle but no awkward sex scenes to navigate. Relationships are deftly drawn and realistically portrayed reflecting the passion with which people live life. The story draws from three generations of women who learn to make their own brave, sometimes foolish, sometimes late-applied choices to achieve a better life. Male characters are as diverse and complex as the female characters. LIFE SONG is a story which can be read as an adventure with a wonderfully funny, distinctly visual narrating style. It can also be reflected on as a snapshot of Australian lifestyle and culture in the 1990s. The author has some great insights about the emergence of women who lead their own bands. This is the sort of novel that delights on a day when the sofa calls. Its appeal is universal. To paraphrase Ian 'Molly' Meldrum - readers should do themselves a favour and go out and buy it. This is a winner for booksellers.",[],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380145106l/18251020.jpg,4.17,338 pages,(first published October 1st 2013),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18251020-life-song,18251020

2216,Dmitry Glukhovsky,Metro 2033,"#The year is 2033. The world has been reduced to rubble. Humanity is nearly extinct. The half-destroyed cities have become uninhabitable through radiation. Beyond their boundaries, they say, lie endless burned-out deserts and the remains of splintered forests. Survivors still remember the past greatness of humankind. But the last remains of civilisation have already become a distant memory, the stuff of myth and legend. ###More than 20 years have passed since the last plane took off from the earth. Rusted railways lead into emptiness. The ether is void and the airwaves echo to a soulless howling where previously the frequencies were full of news from Tokyo, New York, Buenos Aires. Man has handed over stewardship of the earth to new life-forms. Mutated by radiation, they are better adapted to the new world. Man's time is over. ###A few score thousand survivors live on, not knowing whether they are the only ones left on earth. They live in the Moscow Metro - the biggest air-raid shelter ever built. It is humanity's last refuge. Stations have become mini-statelets, their people uniting around ideas, religions, water-filters - or the simple need to repulse an enemy incursion. It is a world without a tomorrow, with no room for dreams, plans, hopes. Feelings have given way to instinct - the most important of which is survival. Survival at any price. VDNKh is the northernmost inhabited station on its line. It was one of the Metro's best stations and still remains secure. But now a new and terrible threat has appeared. ###Artyom, a young man living in VDNKh, is given the task of penetrating to the heart of the Metro, to the legendary Polis, to alert everyone to the awful danger and to get help. He holds the future of his native station in his hands, the whole Metro - and maybe the whole of humanity.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Apocalyptic', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Cultural', 'Russia', 'Science Fiction', 'Apocalyptic', 'Literature', 'Russian Literature', 'Audiobook']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1379621430l/17274667.jpg,4.01,458 pages,(first published April 2002),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17274667-metro-2033,17274667

2218,Don DeLillo,Underworld,"#While Eisenstein documented the forces of totalitarianism and Stalinism upon the faces of the Russian peoples, DeLillo offers a stunning, at times overwhelming, document of the twin forces of the Cold War and American culture, compelling that ""swerve from evenness"" in which he finds events and people both wondrous and horrifying.###Underworld# opens with a breathlessly graceful prologue set during the final game of the Giants-Dodgers pennant race in 1951. Written in what DeLillo calls ""super-omniscience"" the sentences sweep from young Cotter Martin as he jumps the gate to the press box, soars over the radio waves, runs out to the diamond, slides in on a fast ball, pops into the stands where J. Edgar Hoover is sitting with a drunken Jackie Gleason and a splenetic Frank Sinatra, and learns of the Soviet Union's second detonation of a nuclear bomb. It's an absolutely thrilling literary moment. When Bobby Thomson hits Branca's pitch into the outstretched hand of Cotter—the ""shot heard around the world""—and Jackie Gleason pukes on Sinatra's shoes, the events of the next few decades are set in motion, all threaded together by the baseball as it passes from hand to hand.###""It's all falling indelibly into the past,"" writes DeLillo, a past that he carefully recalls and reconstructs with acute grace. Jump from Giants Stadium to the Nevada desert in 1992, where Nick Shay, who now owns the baseball, reunites with the artist Kara Sax. They had been brief and unlikely lovers 40 years before, and it is largely through the events, spinoffs, and coincidental encounters of their pasts that DeLillo filters the Cold War experience. He believes that ""global events may alter how we live in the smallest ways,"" and as the book steps back in time to 1951, over the following 800-odd pages, we see just how those events alter lives. This reverse narrative allows the author to strip away the detritus of history and pop culture until we get to the story's pure elements: the bomb, the baseball, and the Bronx. In an epilogue as breathless and stunning as the prologue, DeLillo fast-forwards to a near future in which ruthless capitalism, the Internet, and a new, hushed faith have replaced the Cold War's blend of dread and euphoria.###Through fragments and interlaced stories—including those of highway killers, artists, celebrities, conspiracists, gangsters, nuns, and sundry others—DeLillo creates a fragile web of connected experience, a communal Zeitgeist that encompasses the messy whole of five decades of American life, wonderfully distilled.","['Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Classics', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'American', 'Americana']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334304280l/11761.jpg,3.93,827 pages,(first published October 3rd 1997),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11761.Underworld,11761

2221,Ta-Nehisi Coates,Between the World and Me,"#“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.”## ##In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?##  ##Between the World and Me #is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, #Between the World and Me #clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.","['Nonfiction', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Race', 'Audiobook', 'History', 'Social Movements', 'Social Justice', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'Writing', 'Essays', 'Cultural', 'African American']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451435027l/25489625._SY475_.jpg,4.40,152 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489625-between-the-world-and-me,25489625

I used to not like God because God didn't resolve. But that was before any of this happened."" ―Donald Miller#In Donald Miller's early years, he was vaguely familiar with a distant God. But when he came to know Jesus Christ, he pursued the Christian life with great zeal. Within a few years he had a successful ministry that ultimately left him feeling empty, burned out, and, once again, far away from God. In this intimate, soul-searching account, Miller describes his remarkable journey back to a culturally relevant, infinitely loving God.#For anyone wondering if the Christian faith is still relevant in a postmodern culture.#For anyone thirsting for a genuine encounter with a God who is real.#For anyone yearning for a renewed sense of passion in  life.#Blue Like Jazz is a fresh and original perspective on life, love, and redemption.","['Nonfiction', 'Christian', 'Religion', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Religion', 'Faith', 'Spirituality', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Religion', 'Theology', 'Christian', 'Christian Living', 'Biography']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1531261584l/7214._SY475_.jpg,3.90,243 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7214.Blue_Like_Jazz,7214

###“This book is just amazingly, wondrously great.” —Alice Walker###In a tower on the New Zealand sea lives Kerewin Holmes: part Maori, part European, asexual and aromantic, an artist estranged from her art, a woman in exile from her family. ###One night her solitude is disrupted by a visitor—a speechless, mercurial boy named Simon, who tries to steal from her and then repays her with his most precious possession. ###As Kerewin succumbs to Simon’s feral charm, she also falls under the spell of his Maori foster father Joe, who rescued the boy from a shipwreck and now treats him with an unsettling mixture of tenderness and brutality. ###Out of this unorthodox trinity Keri Hulme has created what is at once a mystery, a love story, and an ambitious exploration of the zone where indigenous and European New Zealand meet, clash, and sometimes merge.###Winner of both a Booker Prize and Pegasus Prize for Literature, The Bone People is a work of unfettered wordplay and mesmerizing emotional complexity.","['Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Fantasy', 'Literature', '20th Century', 'Book Club']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348988500l/460635.jpg,4.05,450 pages,(first published 1984),https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/460635.The_Bone_People,460635

Far from steadfast in his abhorrence of slavery, Lincoln agonizes over the best course of action and comes to his great decision only when all else seems to fail. As the Civil War ravages his nation, Lincoln must face deep personal turmoil, the loss of his dearest son, and the harangues of a wife seen as a traitor for her Southern connections.

But he’s harboring a secret from his daughter, a love affair he’s keeping all to himself. In “A Choice of Accommodations,” a husband’s attempt to turn an old friend’s wedding into a romantic getaway weekend with his wife takes a dark, revealing turn as the party lasts deep into the night. In “Only Goodness,” a sister eager to give her younger brother the perfect childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish, and anger when his alcoholism threatens her family. And in “Hema and Kaushik,” a trio of linked stories—a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love, and fate—we follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one winter, share a house in Massachusetts.

Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor--a reformed drug dealer and convict--who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. ##Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Albom observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat.##As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Albom and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers, and histories are different, Albom begins to recognize a striking unity between the two worlds--and indeed, between beliefs everywhere.##In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the rabbi's last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself.#Have a Little Faith is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story.# ## #Ten percent of the profits from this book will go to charity, including The Hole In The Roof Foundation, which helps refurbish places of worship that aid the homeless.","['Nonfiction', 'Inspirational', 'Religion', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Spirituality', 'Religion', 'Faith', 'Biography', 'Christian', 'Adult', 'Audiobook']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348911800l/1255781.jpg,4.18,249 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1255781.Have_a_Little_Faith,1255781

Only partly recognizing this place of his cultured, middle-class youth, he is even more disoriented by news of strange events in the wider country: a wave of suicides among girls forbidden to wear their head scarves at school. An apparent thaw of his writer's curiosity–a frozen sea these many years–leads him to Kars, a far-off town near the Russian border and the epicenter of the suicides. ###No sooner has he arrived, however, than we discover that Ka's motivations are not purely journalistic; for in Kars, once a province of Ottoman and then Russian glory, now a cultural gray-zone of poverty and paralysis, there is also Ipek, a radiant friend of Ka's youth, lately divorced, whom he has never forgotten. As a snowstorm, the fiercest in memory, descends on the town and seals it off from the modern, westernized world that has always been Ka's frame of reference, he finds himself drawn in unexpected directions: not only headlong toward the unknowable Ipek and the desperate hope for love–or at least a wife–that she embodies, but also into the maelstrom of a military coup staged to restrain the local Islamist radicals, and even toward God, whose existence Ka has never before allowed himself to contemplate. In this surreal confluence of emotion and spectacle, Ka begins to tap his dormant creative powers, producing poem after poem in untimely, irresistible bursts of inspiration. But not until the snows have melted and the political violence has run its bloody course will Ka discover the fate of his bid to seize a last chance for happiness. ###Blending profound sympathy and mischievous wit, Snow illuminates the contradictions gripping the individual and collective heart in many parts of the Muslim world.

2434,Eoin Colfer,The Lost Colony,"#Alternate Cover Edition for ISBN: 9780786849567###Ten thousand years ago, humans and fairies fought a great battle for the magical island of Ireland. When it became clear to the fairy families that they could never win, they decided to move their civilisation underground and keep themselves hidden from the humans. All the fairy families agreed on this, except the eighth family, the demons.###The demons planned to lift their small island out of time until they had regrouped and were ready to wage war on the humans once more. However, the time spell went wrong, and the island of Hybras was catapulted into Limbo, where it has remained for ten thousand years.###Now, the tainted time spell is deteriorating and demons are being sucked back into the present space and time. The fairy Council are naturally concerned about this and are monitoring any materialisations. When the spell’s deterioration accelerates, the materialisations become unpredictable. Even the fairy scientists cannot figure out where the next demon will pop up.###But someone can. Artemis Fowl, the teenage criminal mastermind, has solved temporal equations that no normal human should be intelligent enough to understand. But Artemis Fowl is no normal human.###So when a confused and frightened demon pops up in a Sicilian theatre, Artemis Fowl is there to meet him. Unfortunately, he is not the only one. A second, mysterious party has also solved the temporal equations, and manages to abduct the demon before Artemis can secure him.###This is a disaster for the fairy People, because this demon was no ordinary fairy. He was the last demon warlock, and as such held the key to the survival of the entire demon race.###It is up to Artemis and his old comrade, Captain Holly Short to track down the missing demon and rescue him before the time spell dissolves completely and the lost demon colony returns violently to Earth.","['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade', 'Adventure', 'Childrens', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Fantasy', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Audiobook']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1522190376l/37586.jpg,4.01,385 pages,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37586.The_Lost_Colony,37586

In another, time is a nightingale, sometimes trapped by a bell jar.###Now translated into thirty languages, #Einstein's Dreams# has inspired playwrights, dancers, musicians, and painters all over the world.
